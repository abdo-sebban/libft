## About

**Libft** is a comprehensive C library that replicates and enhances essential functions from the standard library, along with additional tools like linked list utilities. This project is a fundamental part of the 42 School curriculum and serves as a base for many other projects.

> ðŸš€ **Goal**: To code and compile basic C functions into a reusable library.

## Usage

### Requirements
- **CC** compiler
- Standard **C libraries**

### Compilation
To compile the library, navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
make
```
## Functions
The libft library includes a range of functions that replicate the standard C library and extend it with new utilities. Here is a summary of the core functions:

### -----> Standard Library Functions
ft_memset - Fill a block of memory with a particular value <br>
ft_strlen - Calculate the length of a string. <br>
ft_strcpy - Copy a string to a destination. <br>
ft_strcmp - Compare two strings. <br>
ft_strdup - Duplicate a string in memory. <br>
And many more...<br>
### -----> Memory Management 
ft_memcpy - Copy a block of memory.<br>
ft_memmove - Move a block of memory, safely handling overlaps.<br>
ft_calloc - Allocate and zero-initialize memory.<br>
### -----> String Manipulation
ft_strjoin - Join two strings into a new one.<br>
ft_split - Split a string into an array of strings based on a delimiter.<br>
ft_substr - Extract a substring from a string.<br>
